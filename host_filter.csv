54662715,Mathieu,"Porto, Porto District, Portugal","Originally from France, I have always been keen to discover new countries and cultures. I lived 2 years in Australia where I studied at the University of Southern Queensland. After that I headed back to Paris, thinking to settle down there. After some times I decided to change my life and landed in Porto. I have been living here since 2010.
Since then, I did not manage to get back and got in love with Porto. The seagulls, the Douro and the amazing color of the sun set, will without a doubt, make you also fall in love with this beautiful city.
Make sure that you check out the little guide! There is some nice place to visit!

1381764,Fabio,"Rio de Janeiro, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Olá,

Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio

The Wonderful City of Rio has so much to offer as I have learned from my own experience, from the traditional Samba during Carnival to the less-known Parque das Ruinas in Santa Teresa (all close by the apartment). We never stop living and learning, and whatever you are planning on doing in Rio de Janeiro, you will continue on this path with an open mind in Rio, and add an important chapter to your personal travel memoire, just by absorbing a few of the experiences Rio has on offer. I have travelled most of the world, and still come alive to the sounds of the different rhythms, love the extraordinary food, and the warmth of the local ""cariocas"". I would say my favorite film so far this year is Intouchables. The apartments that I have to offer are fully equipped, well located, and I will personally make sure you enjoy your stay, without invading your space. I live close by, and can be reached almost any time of day or night.

I look forward to meeting you!

Sou Inglês, mais moro no Rio ha 20 anos, tenho dois filhos quem nasceram aqui (agora eles estão estudando fora), e trabalho no mercado financeiro. Acredito nessa cidade maravilhosa e as oportunidades que oferece no futuro - como certamente me passou nas ultimas duas décadas. A gente vive aprendendo, e para qualquer um de vocês planejando visitar Rio de Janeiro, eu diria para ficar com mente aberta, e você vai crescer como uma pessoa, absorvendo só um pouco da experiência Rio tem para lhe provar. Já viajei o mundo, e adoro o som dos ritmos diferentes, comida extraordinária e povo tão caloroso. Meu filme favorito no momento e os Intocáveis. Os apartamentos que tenho para lhe oferecer são bem equipados, localizados, e eu cuido da sua visita pessoalmente, sem invadir seu espaço. Qualquer ajuda, só preciso me ligar - moro bem perto.

6017048,Cheryl,"Escondido, California, United States","I am a first grade teacher who enjoys teaching young children. I grew up in the  the Mid-West and saw the beauty of living in California.  I was born in Venezuela and have always worked on both English and Spanish, and am able to teach both languages.  My dream was to have a home in Hawaii.  I've have spent the last few years traveling  between CA  and many of the Hawaiian Islands in search of the perfect home.  We are settling on the shores of this quaint village.  I am married with one 15 year old son, and one dog Max. I love to hike and the kings trail is close to this house. I love nature and there are wild goats over on Umi street. I love to watch movies and there is netflix at the house. I love geckos and there are brown and green ones at the house. I like deals and the Aloha Beach house is one! There is a king bed now in the master- everytime we go we make the house nicer! It's nicer than our house in California. The master bedroom downstairs is very large and has a queen bed and futon. House can accomodate large groups; I just have to charge extra due to utilities. We get lots of family groups!

This beach house has been a 30 year dream in the making!  It is always so incredible when you see your dreams come true with belief and hard work. Please come and share the  Fantastic Sunsets at  Makai Hideaway- The sunsets are phenomenal and the snorkeling / swimming hole is a two minute walk from the house. The beach is a 15 minute hike from the community center in Milolii. I just enjoyed Easter services with the local people and it was wonderful at the little yellow church in the village. It really is a special place set  near  the last hawaiian fishing village

Além disto não há horário para o café da manhã e posso fazer um lanche ou almoço se não quiser ir a um restaurante.
Procuro trazer as minhas experiências de hospedagem para o meu apartamento, pois quero que o hóspede se sinta confortável, em casa.
Além de gostar muito de viajar, adoro ler e ouvir música e pretendo com o dinheiro que ganho hospedando, poder me hospedar mais pelo mundo a fora. ",within a few hours,Lapa,100.0,True,3

I`m Rafaela, a professional actress who loves the arts.

Maybe I will greeting you in your language. Who Knows?

Amo a natureza, respirar um puro ar e me sentir conectada a energia da terra.
Me sinto muito feliz em receber convidados simpáticos que desejam experimentar ótimos momentos no Rio e desfrutar das alegrias e belezas deste lugar que eu tanto amo.
Botafogo é um bairro  onde a vida histórica e contemporânea convivem com charme a harmonia. Rodeado por montanhas e ruas arborizadas, viver em  Botafogo tem custo mais baixo que os outros bairros da zona sul, aqui é repleto de restaurantes, bares, feiras, museus e eventos culturais que acontecem com muita frequência, o bairro fica a poucos minutos do centro do Rio e dos principais pontos turísticos. A vila onde a casa está localizada foi construída há quase 100 anos, tem muitas árvores que recebem a visita de adoráveis animais da Mata Atlântica.
  A poucos minutos de caminhada  você encontrará a ""Praia de Botafogo"" que compõem uma das vistas mais incríveis do Rio, se preferir pegue o caminho oposto e dê um pulinho na Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, de lá aproveite pra curtir o por do sol no Arpoador.
  Durante muito anos o Rio de Janeiro foi a capital do Brasil, então imagine passear entre as centenárias ruas de paralelepípedos do Centro do Rio, rodeado por prédios memoráveis de  belíssima arquitetura do século 19. 
  O bairro da Urca, onde abriga o bondinho do Pão de Açúcar, está a menos de 15 minutos de ônibus ou táxi.
  O Cristo Redentor  pode ser visto da janela  e você pode chegar a subida do Morro do Corcovado em apenas 15 minutos de ônibus ou táxi.
 Será um prazer compartilhar todas as dicas e lugares especiais que conheci ao longo dos meus anos de vida nesta cidade maravilhosa.

6590093,Kaeo & Karl,Hawaii Island,"More about us below but First a Lava and Park Update as of 1.16.19
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has reopened on Septemb (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) However due to the Government shut down limited areas within the main Park are accessible. Still very much worth the visit.  The Kahuku Units remains open.

After three months of eruptions in lower Puna punctuated by a damaging wildfire that burned nearly 3,800 acres of forest on Mauna Loa and Hurricane Lane lashing the Island with heavy rains and strong winds at the end of August the Island of Hawaii is in recovery mode and regaining normalcy.  AND we have a new Black Sand Beach at Pohoiki which IS accessible.

The USGS and Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are reporting that sulfur dioxide emissions at Kilauea summit and in the Lower East Rift Zone in Puna, where lava flows were occurring, have fallen drastically since the start of August and are at their lowest combined level in more than a decade.

Kilauea's latest eruption began May 3 with lava flowing continuously until Aug. 6. The affected Puna area, in the southeast corner of the island comprises one percent of the island of Hawaii, which is larger than all of the other Hawaiian Islands combined.  We are in Upper Puna and were not affected by the flow.
Visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park   OR  USGS Kilauea for future updates.

KAEO is an enthusiastic gardener,occasional travel agent, sometimes Hula Girl, Hawaii born, ambassador to the culture, caregiver, former Ad exec and sometimes 'pretty good cook'.  She has lived on Oahu, Maui and now the ""best""-Island of Hawaii.  I've hiked hundreds on miles on ALL the islands, in past days:  Mauna Loa, Waimanu, Polipoli, Waihee, Wailau, Hauula, the Koolaus & Wainae Mountains.  A kayak trip to Kalalau circumvented the difficult 10.8m hike.  KARL is a master tile setter and works on all phases of the Carpentry, Remodel & Building Industry.  He built Eco Hale; we estimate using at least 60% re-purposed materials.  He also built our home in Mountain View and worked with his family numerous times on the Mainland and Hawaii to build their homes.  He is a Huge sports fan (Raiders in particular).  Karl comes from a family that simply needs their toothbrush when someone announces ""Road Trip""; hence thousands of miles visiting U.S. parks, cities and sights.  Our romance began on the island of Maui and our adventure, commitment and curiosity to/for one another continues.
We love the entrepreneurial, independent alternative lifestyle and very much enjoy sharing our slice of paradise in the rain forest.  Our lives have been enriched by the many guests from around the world who enjoy privacy and nature.

16130307,John,"Kihei, Hawaii, United States","Aloha: This Kihei Bay Surf spacious, comfortable studio suite is across the street from the ocean. Its ideal location in North Kihei is close to restaurants, many beaches, and interesting activities. From your lanai, you will see an ancient Hawaiian fish pond where green sea turtles sometimes come to bask; there is a quiet, shaded park, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (the only sanctuary dedicated to to humpback whales), and an awesome Indian restaurant right on the ocean. Located near the beginning of the longest uninterrupted white sand beach in the whole state, you can run (or walk) from our unit all the way (six miles -in front of Kihei Canoe Club, Maui Canoe Club and a few condos to the protected area along the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge and board walk) to Maalaea Harbor (with the excellent Maui Ocean Center, Maui Golf & Sports park for the kids, many restaurants, Pacific Whale Foundation - and a bus stop to deliver you back in front of Kihei Bay Surf. Our complex has a good swimming pool, hot jacuzzi, tennis courts, BBQ area, and clean laundry facilities. 

Our corner unit is bigger and has more light than most of the other units in our complex. The wrap-around lanai offers more space than the other units as well. It has a queen bed and a sofa couch for sleeping. The unit has been renovated and upgraded several times since my mom first lived there when she arrived on Maui from Chicago in 1985 to teach English at Maui College. She loved her job and Kihei -- and she met a nice, handsome counsellor working at the college. They got married - and had me. 

And I just got married in August to my beautiful bride, who has a 8-year-old son. We feel very blessed. And we hope to share our love of place with you. 

At KBS, you will be close to Kihei Canoe Club, where both my mom and I have done competitive outrigger canoe paddling. You can experience being out on the water if you go to the KCC Visitor Paddle on Tuesday or Thursday morning. Get there by 7:15 am to make sure you get a spot. During the winter, you may see whales while you are on the water. Allow a couple of hours for the experience. My mom is a volunteer for the HIHWNMS - the free museum and whale sanctuary across the street. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can hear a free lecture from 11am until noon about the Humpback Whales. The museum is open from 10am-3pm, Monday-Friday, and on the last Saturday of the month from 10am-1pm. The mission is to educate the public and protect humpback whales and other marine life and our environment. 

Another activity that is nearby is Hawaiian singing, ukulele, and hula on Thursday nights from 7-8:30 pm. at the Keolahou Church, 177 S. Kihei Rd. It is joyful - and a glimpse of Hawaiian culture.

We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  

We want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  

Our vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.

We are family of four from Calgary Canada. We went to Hawaii once and fell in love with pretty much everything.

So we decided to buy a second home to use whenever we can. When not able to use it ourselves we rent it out and like to share our enjoyment with people that like to visit Hawaii.

I live in a big penthouse, which I'm gradually improving. I've tried Airbnb before as a guest and since mid-2014 I've been a host. I try to become a friend to my guests, helping them to take the best of my wonderful city with safety and comfort. I speak fluent English, Spanish, Portuguese (of course), but I also understand German and other Latin-based languages. I have a young mind, love outdoors activity, bike, running at the beach, but also reading, music (from rock to opera) and travel. I'm quite easygoing, sociable and talkative. Hope to see you soon in Rio!

Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico.

As business travelers we have had the opportunity to visit some of the most amazing cities but none of these locations have come close to the feeling of peace and serenity that we have found in Wailea. Grand Champions Villas is hands down the greatest value in all of Wailea. The central location, beautifully maintained grounds, security and space within the villas cannot be beat. The villa is perfected by a truly beautiful interior with a fresh, relaxing vibe. It was our goal to bring the beauty we saw in the grounds of Wailea to the interior of the villa where we spend time with our family creating cherished memories.

I am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.

I have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.

19887538,Oporto Rental Management,PT,"Four friends, a lot of dreams, a common path

Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

Oporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos: a Rosa, a Tânia, o Igor e o Nuno. A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

Booking tip: I encourage you to book asap if the days in calendar are open or as soon as I reply to you. I don't know how the guest part system works. But I've had people who send inquiries to whom I've sent pre-approved responses. This doesn't mean anything until you actually book (make the payment). During this time I can still pre-approve other people and even other guests can go ahead of you and our previous conversations and book! They will actually get the booking.

We dreamed that one day we might be able to make Kauai our permanent home, and we were fortunate to actually make this happen in January of (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) We bought our second vacation rental property at Puamana in August of last year (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , as our second vacation rental property. and after a renovation period, placed it on line as a 3 bedroom 2 bath townhouse vacation rental.
My wife still works as a flight attendant and I am retired (for all the guys out there, I'll be writing a book soon about how to make that happen).  However, I keep busy managing both properties, when we're not dancing, playing softball/tennis, or at the beach.  One of the advantages of living here on Kauai and offering vacation properties for rent is that any issues with units that may arise are addressed immediately and decisively through direct communication between the guests and me, the owner. There is no go-between management company in the loop to delay any action that may be required.  It's a win-win for everyone.

Although I do miss my family on the mainland, I (we) have our other half with us here, Mother and Father in law moved here 12+ yrs  and my Brother and sister in law just 2+ years ago! Being able to get together every Sunday to cook and enjoy each other is something I don’t take for granted.  Love the ocean, with my favorite past time now which is stand up paddle boarding. I was a Dental Assistant for a total of 18 yrs, then quit to help my husband run his construction company. Never did I think I would be doing a bnb, (always have done long term) but oh how I enjoy it!! Love people and enjoy them seeing the islands for their first time or coming back for more to do something they missed or needs repeating...never can one see it all. I hope you will come and enjoy our little slice of Hawaii here on the west side of the island. ",within an hour,Ewa,100.0,True,4

8096835,Steven,"St Peters, New South Wales, Australia","Inveterate traveller who has spent a great proportion of my life on the road benefiting from the kindness of strangers - hitched, trekked, bicycled, motorcycled and trained independently to all sorts of far flung and unpronounceable points of the globe. Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.
I like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...

During my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.
A well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.

As you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.

My home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)

My place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.
If you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.
Our fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.
The vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.

In any case hopefully our genuine hospitality and relaxed easy welcome will allow you to overlook some rougher edges in evolution and allow us to reciprocate the marvelous generosity we've benefited from in our travels.

I can offer you 1 bedroom flat or studios in the center of the istanbul,at the location Taksim square meets. For surroundings please give me couple of minutes by reading below.

History of the Location of the apartment: 

The main thoroughfare is İstiklâl Caddesi, running into the neighbourhood from Taksim Square, a pedestrianised 300meter of shops, cafés, patisseries, restaurants, pubs, wine houses and clubs, as well as bookshops, theatres, cinemas and art galleries. Some of İstiklâl has a 19th century metropolitan character, and the avenue is lined with Neoclassical and Art Nouveau buildings.[citation needed] The nostalgic tram which runs on İstiklal Avenue, between Taksim Square and Tünel, was also re-installed in the early 1990s with the aim of reviving the historic atmosphere of the district. 
Some of the city's historic pubs and winehouses are located in the areas around İstiklal Avenue in Beyoğlu. The 19th century Çiçek Pasajı (literally Flower Passage in Turkish, or Cité de Péra in French, opened in 1876) on İstiklal Avenue can be described as a miniature version of the famous Galleria in Milan, Italy, and has rows of historic pubs, winehouses and restaurants",within an hour,Taksim,93.1168987037926,False,3

I started bartending and quickly got to know a lot of the insurance and outs of Oahu. My career has brought me so much joy, and introduced me to some of the best people on Earth.

A little bit about myself: I have a degree in Architecture, and own a construction company. I love building and seeing the smile on people's faces when they see the home of their dreams, it puts a smile in my heart. 

The same happiness I get from building, I get from hosting; I love to meet people from all walks of life learn about their cultures, and see the smile on their face when they arrive in my home.

In my free time I enjoy spending it with my family and friends, having a nice glass of good wine with my loved ones, and taking my dogs out for a swim at the beach on a beautiful sunny day.

We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  

We want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  

Our vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  

Stop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.  A hui hou (until we meet again)!

9070329,Alexandra,"Porto, Porto District, Portugal","My main hobby is searching; I search about everything related to life-style, design, arquitecture, decoration, fashion, restaurants, shops, cool places in general and, I confess, gossip!
Poker was a mix of hobby and profession, it came to me by fun, playing online but, started to met people in the real world, and
writing for magazines and websites. During 8 years I had an weekly column in J magazine, what ended with an invitation to cooperate with BetClick for the Poker section in their Portuguese branch office. 
To handle my Poker consulting business, I founded ""Coisas do Poker"" (""Things about Poker). 
But, my real passion is interior design and receive people.
Until now, I only practiced in in-house projects, for personal needs, in the different appartments where I lived.
For eight years, I lived in Luxembourg, where I worked in the headquarters of the European Community Parliament, revising texts for the Portuguese publications.
After a short return to Portugal, I went to Brazil for one year, this time, just for fun, where I lived in Araras and Rio de Janeiro.
Now I've embraced, somehow, professional projects in these areas, like this WBwGG"" (White Basement with Green Garden"", the ""Caramba!"" and the ""WHwTG"" (White House with Tasca Gourmet).
The ""Caramba!"" is an, already running, project with my friend Marina where we convert old fashioned furniture, and objects, into cool stuff.
Most of my parent's furniture will be the guinea pig and, once transformed, will be exposed in hot spots in the city but, also, in the house, where guests can see and even use.
The ""WHwTG"" is on his half way to launch, it's also a guest house but in the countryside, in Póvoa da Raínha, a very small place on the way to Serra da Estrela.
This is my grandparent's house, a typical old stone house of the Portuguese countryside, which I've adapted to be comfortable but keeping the original trace.
The purpose here is, not only, receive guests but, also, open the ""tasca gourmet"" to serve, and sell, regional food and beverage and promote tasting events.
With luck, the project in Póvoa da Raínha can be extended for the family lands that will face the water mirror of the future Girabolhos dam, under construction and, expected to be finished in one, or two years.

Here is a little of myself, what I've been doing and future projects but, here, may main goal is to have the chance to receive, the best possible, everyone who decides to visit us; that will be an enormous pleasure!

I'm pretty free spirited and try to enjoy all the perks of living in Inwood! I love to hike difficult trails and like buying clothes to hike in -- although I might like buying the clothes more than hiking sometimes!   : )

I'm a huge fan of Inwood Park. It's not like Central Park at all (not that CP is bad but Inwood Park wasn't man-made). There are fewer people and it's a great place to be alone and think.  You can go to the weekly farmers market which is across the street every Saturday morning and then go on a morning hike, play tennis, basketball or soccer before finally laying out to work on your tan. Later you can watch the sunset over the Hudson River or perhaps go on a sunset hike. It really is nice up here! Come see what I see!! 

I also co-run THRIFTAHOLICS com & NYC GRINDHOUSE com with my boyfriend Michael. If you like thrifting, or want to do things in NYC cheaply, or even for FREE when you get here, you should definitely check out our site. We can get you very cheap tickets to Broadway shows!

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

If you have any questions, want to hear about an apartment or just say hi, don´t hesitate to reach out :)

Have a great day!

I'm Sarah, french girl living in Montreal since 3 years!
I'm a graphic designer working in an Architecture agency.
For sure I love travelling and have the time of my life each time I discover new things, new cultures, new people... 
What I love the most in traveling is to get lost, and appropriate the place. My ultimate dream is to live on a boat, dive and observe fish all day long. 
I'm also crazy about local gastronomy, I love discover a country/city by eating all kind of food that I see. 

Most of the time I travel with my boyfriend Pierre-Luc, he is a designer, he creates all kind of things,with metal & wood furniture, he is so brillant. 
Our latest crazy move was to restore an old loft in one of the best Montreal's district. We created all the furniture by ourselves.
Thanks for reading me!

Uncles, aunts and cousins doing God's work all over the world, people not principally interested in money. Not to say that I do not approve of wealth and power. My grandfather, after all, was a wealthy man, founding a watch company more than 100 years ago, but let your good fortune be applied for a good purpose. 

Religion, however, is too confusing for me to understand, so I stick to nature. This is my guide in life. And it has worked very well for me so far. For these reasons, science, culture, politics. social justice, economics and all the things that make this world go round are of great interest to me. I'm green politically, blue in many ways, my eyes, my jeans, my bathroom towels, my mood once in a while, blue is good, I feel fine. Red and black attracts me, but generally, I will try to keep a cool head. White is beautiful, but what or who is spotless? Yellow and orange are great, who does not like sunshine? But I prefer gold. And silver would be my blue. It suites me better. I'll tell you more at a later point. 

Blond originally, but most hair that remains on my body is in all other places than on my head. I shave off the rest, with some stubble remaining once in a while when I'm just too lazy. I am a mountain person, strong, agile, in good shape. Style? Always appropriate for the occasion. Quality is what matters. And who does not recognize that, oh well, simply does not recognize it.

10472286,Ray,"Montreal, Quebec, Canada","We are avid travelors and enjoy staying at vacation rentals, like the one we have created here. We enjoy the experience because staying at a vacation rental gives one a sense of the character of the city and people you are visiting -- something you don't get from the ""sterility"" of the hotel stay.  In that light, we are proud to be able to offer our guests an opportunity to stay in an apartment that is typical of the sort built after the war to accomodate the returning service men and their families.  The neighborhood is very much residential and varied in population age wise and linguistically.  It is only a block away from a major commerical artery and very close to the metro system.

 About myself, I am a biologist who now works in education at a College in downtown montreal.  While I am very much anchored in the scientific mind set, my reading pleasure invariably centers around history -- mostly western civilization -- and art.   We enjoy living in Montreal because of its cultural richness, and benefit from all the opportunites ranging from theatre productions to museum exhibits, etc.  We also enjoy hiking through the Laurentians and the richness of the environment that surrounds Montreal, which is not that far away.

Whether you come to stay here or not, I think you will enjoy visiting this unique city in the North America.  Montreal is sure to satisfy you at many levels, and we wish you a pleasant stay.

We renovated it completely and tried to keep it as original as possible. We did most of the work ourselves, so it took about 4 years to complete it. Since we had more space than we needed, we decided to give Airbnb a try and it's being a really good experience since. We have been lucky to have nice guests that share many common interests and have a fun time in the city.

I work also with photography (artistic, street) and some graphic design. Davi works as a carpenter building furniture. Most of the house's furniture was made by him.

115444556,Don,"Surry Hills, New South Wales, Australia",I bought the building in 1996 in a very run down state. It was originally a grand Victorian Terrace and had been divided into 5 flats with shared bathrooms.  I embarked on a full renovation with my builder and later employer Michael Wagstaffe which included building another level on top where I now live. I decided to trial Airbnb in mid 2017 in the smallest apartment which has been very successful. In December 2017 apartment 5 became vacant so I upgraded  it for Airbnb to be ready for NYE. I   have installed double glazing and acoustic flooring to make my guests stay as comfortable as possible.  My building is in  vibrant Surry Hills so you can step out the door and find restaurants and bars a plenty than come back to peace and quiet. I try to give the best service possible to my guests.,within an hour,Surry Hills,100.0,True,3

2349948,Hawaii Dream Realty TEAM,"Honolulu, Hawaii, United States","ALOHA and WELCOME to Waikiki, Honolulu on Oahu!  Thank you for your interest in one of our vacation rentals.  We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  

We want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  

Our vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  

Stop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.  A hui hou (until we meet again)!

Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa.

Hello all the way from İstanbul, Turkey.
I welcome anybody who wishes to enjoy the comfort of staying at a nice apartment just in the very center of İstanbul at Swiss Suits.

During my trips around the world somehow Ifound my self running Swiss suits after completing  my degree in physical training. i believe everybody would agree with me that what feels great is to pay less for housing but enjoying the city you travel by spending more on other things rather than paying high cost hotel fees. Being aware of this, I want my guest feel the same and enjoy being İstanbul as much as they can.
ı guarantee a nice and clean accommodation, low cost recommendation, anything about the city and Turkish hospitality.
We would be pleased to welcome you here. Swiss Suites is located in the Taksim area and is literally 3 steps away from the Istiklal Street.

We are Carl and Edna.  We have been coming to stay here at this property for almost 15 years, and then our adult children persuaded us to finally buy. We were very fortunate to find out that the unit we had been renting for many years came up for sale. So, of course  we bought and put our stamp on the unit that was already  filled with many happy Hawaiian memories for us both.

Carl and I come here from December through to end of March every year.  We meet the other winter-returning unit owners  (snowbirds) and thoroughly enjoy the winter Hawaiian Family that keeps us coming back year after year!

Returning to Hawaii is our focus dream every year. We want our kids to enjoy it as we enjoy it, and therefore you too.  Hawaii is calling - answer the call:)

Thank you for choosing our little piece of Paradise - we wish you as many happy Hawaiian Memories as we have created over the years!!

3168214,William,"Montreal, Quebec, Canada","I am a 26 year old student at McGill University. After several experiences with AirBnB, i realized that not only is this the new way to travel, but it is also an excellent opportunity to network with different people from all over the world! I love travelling, and the prospect of meeting new people from around the world makes AirBnB an awesome experience for myself and my roommates.

One of my best trips so far was a roadtrip across the United States. I have made this trip twice and it's amazing to see how peoples' lives vary across the country. We met many travellers along the way through AirBnB, which really inspired me to set up something similar in my own home.

Most recently, I travelled to the United Kingdom as an exchange student and during the weekends, I backpacked around Europe. My experience here was completely different from my previous travels in the United States and in Asia. It really provided me a different view of the world, not simply the North American view, and this has allowed me to communicate better with people who don't speak fluent English. Most importantly, there is an instant bond/connection that is made when I meet someone who is either from a city I have travelled to, or has been there as well! 

I hope to hear about where you are from, and some of the places you have visited, to help give myself a better idea of where I want to travel to next!

Comecei a hospedar profissionalmente a pouco tempo, mas tenho certa experiencia, pois hospedei em minha casa, muitos amigos e familiares ao longo dos 20 anos que resido no Rio de Janeiro.
Sou gaúcha, nasci do RS e mudei para a cidade maravilhosa a 20 anos. Amo minha terra, meu sul, mas me apaixonei perdidamente pelo RJ. Cheguei aqui muito novinha, decidi ficar, trabalhei bastante para isso e consegui! lembro me que assim que cheguei, por mais que eu trabalhasse e não tivesse muito tempo para diversõe, estava sempre com a impressão de que estava de férias, acredito que pela proximidade do mar e pela descontração dos cariocas.
Estudei, me formei aqui ( Direito), e toda a minha vida construi nesta cidade. Sempre gostei de hospedar e hoje, fazendo isso profissionalmente posso dizer que é sempre um prazer, adoro idéias e culturas diferentes. Tambem sou uma viajante, sempre que posso tento conhecer novos lugares, minha última viagem  foi a Turquia, uma viagem inteiramente inusitada, mas que adorei. Por esse motivo tento me colocar no lugar do hospede, procuro dar boas dicas de diversão e locais interessantes na cidade maravilhosa.
E por falar em cidade maravilhosa, essa realmente é uma cidade maravilhosa, temos belezas naturais, gente bonita, temos a descontração e a simpatia do povo carioca e adoramos receber turistas que, normalmente se encantam e retornam diversas vezes ao RJ.
Bom, tento ser pontual ( não esquecendo que estamos no RJ e as vezes o transito nos castiga bastante), cumpro com o prometido, sou uma pessoa correta, prezo a palavra  e gosto que sejam assim comigo tambem.

O sucesso foi tão grande que passado o tempo, meus amigos e amigos de amigos, passaram a me pedir para que administrasse os seus apartamentos. Topei o desafio, e os apartamentos foram se multiplicando... larguei a Faculdade de Geografia e decidi empreender, me dedicando exclusivamente aos meus hóspedes ! Foi a melhor decisão que tomei na vida.

 came to ask me to manage their listings. I accept the challenge, and the number of apartments was multiplying ... I left the University of Geography and decided to dedicate myself exclusively to my guests ! It was the best decision I ever made.

After some years I founded my own agency, Omar do Rio (Omar from Rio), specialized in Vacation Rentals and today I manage innumerable seasonal apartments in the city. I realized myself by being able to work with an activity that I love so much, that added so much to my life.

My goal today, with my agency, is to provide a safe, quiet and quality stay, so that my guests can enjoy the experience in the Marvelous City.

Count on me and my Team to get all the support and best tips you can have in town.

See you in Rio!

Omar

67772371,Fabio,"Rio de Janeiro, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Olá,

Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Fabio

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio

I've been living and working part of each year in Australia, part in Tokyo, and little working trips all over the place.

I write a Magazine column in Japanese, 'Cecilia's Permacutlure Slow Life'. Its about creative ways to de-trap your life of wasted time, energy and affection, freeing you up to do the good work you were put on this world to do. 

For more than 10 years I've run a share-house for creative people - you can read about it on my blog Balcony Garden Dreaming.

My hobbies are Japanese tea ceremony, creative dinner gatherings and drawing illustrations of the quirky world I dream to live in, and often actually do.  

I've been a WWOOF host for many years, hosting travellers who volunteer their talents to help look after this house, garden and all its creatures.  

I don't have a life motto exactly, but when thing go wrong, I ask myself 'Whiner or Designer?'.  That gets me positive and resourceful.  If things go wrong for you I won't say it though. I'll just help where I can xx

I have created this project with the aim of showing Oporto to the world.
In its multiplicity of angles, this experienced and intimate city vibrates in secret places, landscapes, stories and events. Who lives there or passes by, feel it deeply.
Then, FEELPORTO passes through the common interest of the larger community of those who inhabit the city, also in the heart.
And because Oporto is part of the heart of the north of this country, its community expands through and beyond its borders. Therefore, this project is open to all interested in approaching this sense, promoting their ideas and interests on a regular basis.
This way, it can provide all visitors experiences and emotions parallel to the usual and special itineraries. I propose, therefore, that are also the unconditional city lovers, from north to south of Portugal and beyond, to be a part of this community FEELPORTO ... Because Port is Beautiful.

Wow!  'Ohana Nui owes it all to the 1000+ great guests over the last 8 years that have come with a fun fresh and positive outlook on their travel and vacation.  Thank you everyone for making 'Ohana Nui what it is.

Aloha!  We are Brendan and family, and we enjoy sharing our beautiful three story home, 'Ohana Nui, with respectful travelers from around the world.   Brendan, single father of 2, is retired from construction (early) to be a full time dad, world traveler, and Airbnb Host.  He loves to ""talk story"" and Stand Up Paddle Surf.  The kids, though not here all the time, are two well-behaved, respectful children (ages 11 and 12) who love meeting all the ""Uncles and Aunties"" in the house.

Our newest addition to the team, Colin, is a career driven full time student, and now co-host that takes care of many of the day to day aspects of Ohana Nui and Ohana Nui Motors in Brendan's absence.  What more can we say about him, Colin is Awesome!

We keep our home smoke-free and drug-free.  We also keep everything clean and tidy.  We do not have a party house by any means, just a nice place to relax and make new friends.  

The name of our home, 'Ohana Nui, means Big Family, which is what we aspire to be to our guests.  Our family is as rich and diverse as the colors of our flag and we show aloha to all.  We strive to provide everyone with all the comforts of home; with safety, quality, and affordability; and to provide every guest with a great local feeling and local experience, all the while, just outside of Waikiki.

We count our sea-change to Hawaii as one of the best things we ever did and we absolutely love this place!  Surrounded by wild beauty, turquoise waters, bright sunshine, friendly towns, pristine beaches, epic sunsets, gleaming waterfalls, warm water, lush mountain ranges, and the sound of tropical breezes rustling through the palm trees, how could we not?
Matt and I have been married for almost 13 years and have two sons:  Ryker, who is at the very fun, adventurous age of 4, and Finn who is at the loveable age of 2.5. We also have high hopes to add more kiddos sometime in the future.  
A little about us:  we LOVE Hawaii.  The beach is our favorite playground; building sandcastles with the boys, surfing, cruising on our SUP boards, joy-riding waves to shore, exploring the underwater world with mask and snorkel, kayaking, hiking- we just can’t get enough.

I live and work in downtown Montreal. People usually describe me as a smily and a very friendly guy.

I traveled in nearly 50 countries around the globe and far from stopping there. There is so much to discover and to learn. 

What I like from travelling is the feeling of excitement to discover a new place, trying to communicate in a new language, meeting new people, trying new exotic food and learn from the others. It's great to break the routine and leave it's comfort zone.

Then, FEELPORTO passes through the common interest of the larger community of those who inhabit the city, also in the heart.
And because Oporto is part of the heart of the north of this country, its community expands through and beyond its borders. Therefore, this project is open to all interested in approaching this sense, promoting their ideas and interests on a regular basis.
This way, it can provide all visitors experiences and emotions parallel to the usual and special itineraries. I propose, therefore, that are also the unconditional city lovers, from north to south of Portugal and beyond, to be a part of this community FEELPORTO ... Because Port is Beautiful.

3321901,John,"Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","I live between Rio de Janeiro and the San Francisco bay area in California.  I am a public radio DJ with a Brazilian music radio program for the last 30 years.  I am also a story teller and have a knack for making people laugh. 

I love the outdoors and especially cycling up to the Christ statue or in the hills above Silicon Valley.  I am very familiar with the musical scene of Rio and can be your guide or give you the information you need.

I am a native English speaker and speak fluent Portuguese and passable Japanese.  I also can make myself understood in Spanish.

My philosophy as a host:  My parents were very successful small business owners with a carnation farm and later a flower shop. They had their business listed in the best of Silicon Valley and even had local TV coverage.  Out of hundreds of similar businesses, they were able to differentiate themselves on how they treated and interacted with their customers.  They worked hard to give that little extra that made people want to come back.  My goal as a host is to treat as you my parents would have.  Let me show my definition of hospitality.  

Moro entre o Rio de Janeiro e nos suburbos de San Francisco, em Califórnia. Sou um DJ de rádio educativo com um programa de Música Brasileira para os últimos 30 anos. 

Eu gosto de pedalar na floresta da Tijuca subindo para o Corcovado ou nas colinas de Silicon Valley em California. Conheço bem a cena musical do Rio e possa o seu guia ou dar-lhe as informações sobre o que você deveria fazer na Cidade Maravilhosa.

Eu falo inglês e português fluentemente. Eu também entendo bastante espanhol e japônes para comunicar.

Minha filosofia como anfitrião: meus pais eram proprietários de pequena empresa muito bem sucedido com um sítio de floricultura e depois uma loja de flores. Eles tinham seus negócios listados no melhor de ""Silicon Valley"" e até tinham cobertura de TV local. Das centenas de empresas similares, eles conseguiram se diferenciar com o atendimento único aos seus clientes. Eles trabalharam um pouco mais para fazer os clientes sempre voltar. Meu objetivo como anfitrião é tratar como você teria os meus pais. Deixe-me mostrar minha definição de hospitalidade.",within an hour,Leme,100.0,True,8

22091788,Graça,"Matosinhos, Porto District, Portugal","I've been a camper from the age of 6! I used to go camping with my parents on a scooter. Every summer, me and my family used to go travelling through Europe on a caravan. Recently I upgraded to a campervan as it is a more sustainable option and is easier to drive and park. I love the freedom it provides for a touring holiday or escaping into Nature and my mission is to share this experience with fellow travellers. 

Our campervans provide freedom on wheels. So guests can travel with no restrictions and no ties. With no need to book hotels, no arrival schedules to limit you, no pre-paid programs to follow. It is about total freedom of choice and use to explore or relax.

You can get closer to Nature. Fall asleep under the starry sky, wake up in the middle of the mountains, have breakfast by the sea. The perfect companion for outdoor activities surrounded by Nature. Pick up your gear and go explore!

We are locals with a passion for travel and gastronomy keen on giving advice and proud of their travel library! We can suggest travel itineraries. We are specially keen on the North of Portugal region as its varied landscapes, heritage and people make it a fabulous destination that all travellers love!

Looking forward to providing you with the adventure of a lifetime!

1617817,Chris,"New York, New York, United States","I have been home-sharing for about 10 years now and have met many interesting people. I view visitors more as short-term roommates than I do as guests.

Home-sharing truly has been a blessing for me. It's helped me to pay the rent and still given me the flexibility to have the place all to my own when I'd like to do so. That's a huge benefit!

As a guest, I have used Airbnb to travel to Tokyo and spent a few weekends staying at a farmhouse outside New York City. We watched films on the side of a barnhouse. Very cool!

I am a relatively easy-going guy. I drink socially and do not smoke or use drugs. I definitely like to have fun, especially if it involves doing something new and it doesn't cost a ton of money. I love deals!

While I tend to be easy-going, I do have my pet-peeves. For example, a shoes-free home means just that. With that said, I ask that you please review the house ""rules"" before you book with me.

Either as a host or a guest, I'd be up for hanging out some time. I like to meet new people and explore the city together. If you'd like to hang out during your visit, then let me know in advance. My work schedule is pretty unpredictable and I often do work from home. I can get pretty busy, but if you give me some advance notice I'll make sure we have time to spend together. Otherwise, I generally assume that guests want independence.

If you prefer to do your own thing, then that's totally fine too. Don't worry I won't be offended. I can certainly appreciate that you may have a pretty full itinerary when you come to NYC.

I'm a former journalist, PR guy and worked for a non-profit in the sustainable agriculture / environmental field for many years. I started my own coaching/consulting business a few years ago and would be interested to find out more about what's going on in your life. Perhaps I can help you out in some way?

My guests have included a combination of tourists and business travelers. Whichever category you fall under, you're welcome to stay with me. I have an extra room and I'd be happy to provide you with an opportunity to step into the shoes of a New York City resident for a while. Who knows? Maybe you'll like the East Village so much that you'll want to find your own apartment and never want to leave.

I host singles and couples, but you should note that there is an added fee of $30 per night for all additional guests over one person.

The most common things I hear from guests are:

""The room is so much bigger than I thought based on the photos in your listing,""

""This is a really cool room/place!""

""I love the natural light that comes into this room!""

""It's such a comfy atmosphere in here that I really hate to leave!""

Guests really love the location! location! location!

On the flip side, I sometimes hear people remark that walking up five flights is ""telling them that they need to get into better shape.""

If nothing else, I hope that you'll find your visit with me to be enlightening (that's a joke because the bedroom is well-lit and I am a life coach ;)

Under Archsense Apartments and ArchSense Barcelona brands, we are a young and dynamic company that is dedicated to personalized management of tourist apartments and houses in two diferent areas in Spain. In Barcelona  (Catalunya) and Pontevedra (Galicia).

Our management comprises different phases, from the initial search of clients, reception and accommodation in the apartment until his departure. We also take care of the apartment all clean and conditioning time, and to resolve any issues that may arise during a guest's stay.
The main goal of our management is twofold:

- Provide the owner a full service under which you can forget about the worries and concerns the operation of holiday rental, knowing that the investment in the business will bring greater benefits than the option of ""traditional"" rent.
- Get the highest customer satisfaction, ensuring their comfort, in order to make your stay in our apartments result in all the most pleasant time possible.

Our differences with other organizations dedicated to the tourist apartment sector lies in providing special pampering to the customer, feeling to be at their own home and have at all the time a ""friend"" of reference in the city. This person (me or some of my collaborators) speaks your language, and will help you to solve any questions or problems and looking for suggestions of leisure in the city. 
All this expertise  has allowed us to grow gradually, as the viral marketing has proven to be our best advertising tool, and thus many customers and many others have repeated recommend us to their family and friends.

I can only do first book first serve basis, where I won't cancel current booking just because other guests have a longer / bigger booking.  Due to strict cancellation policy, I haven't cancel guest booking so far, except from time to time having guest need to cancel or amend their booking due to different reason and we will considerate case by case (so far only full refund to 1 group of guest as they are able to provide document to proof that their immediate family member need emergency operation). 

Max Capacity is cater to big group consists of family n kids with standard asian size.  If group with members with huge body size or some members prefer to have a bed by their own, not sharing with other, then please split your group into two apartments for more comfortable stay.  I have tried my best to write the apartment description as detail as I could. Please spend time to read through before you book.  I am definitely happy to answer any question that is not in the apartment description.


Contact Number and Email Information will only be released until a booking is made.

10716263,Carolina,"Wainiha, Hawaii, United States","Hello Airbnb Community, 

My name is Carolina and I am... a little bit.... gypsy. I love to travel, to learn new cultures, study languages and people, get to know new people and new ways of living. I am currently living in Hawaii, studying to be a midwife, working as a doula (Angels who help sister deliver babies) and managing a few projects in Rio. So although I visit Rio for 3 months a year, Im based in Hawaii and also get to travel around the globe. 

 I can say I am a people's person and love to make people feel good, from hosting to cooking, to massage, thru teaching yoga... etc. I just love to share the things that make me passionate about life in this world. 

That's why I love to talk about Brazil, travel around Brazil and to share the features of this amazing country I am proud to be from. Brazil is my home and Rio is my heart. I am born and raised in Rio, and have experienced this city in a lot of different ways. Here I have been a Law student with long downtown areas and party scenes at night, I've been a nature seeker with long trail/nature hours and good sleep at night, I've been an artist with long days dancing and knowing the theatre/circus scene, I explored Rio as total tourist living in a hostel, and now I have been exploring it while working with education as a citizen and cultural productor. I grow up and its seems that Rio grows up with me. Its always different and better, everytime I come home.

When I travel, I like to feel like I am from there. I like to feel like I am doing what the locals do, feel that I am interacting with the place and its people in its fullest, and so I am a very open traveler. When I host, I like to understand peoples needs, a person who comes to Rio for a bussiness journey, will have different expectations of a person who is traveling for tourism. Or a person who is traveling with family, thinks different than someone who wants to enjoy the party scene in Rio, etc. So, I do love to hear from you, and I will do my best to accommodate your needs. 

Since I don't live full time in Brazil, and because together we can reach places we could never reach alone, I have lovely a co-host who helps me with this. Together we want to create unique ways for our guests to feel welcome.

That's why, we want to hear from you, your opinion is very important to us on this new journey. Our ideal is that the world can be only one, we are one and can live likewise, with love. A big community of people that altogether we can do beautiful things for ourselves, our community, our planet. We want to show love to people, and part of it, we will do by hosting you on the best way we can. 

What is your ideal? How can you feel home? What are things that could improve your experience in a new country? How do you like to meet people? What are your intentions with your trip? If you could choose something, anything, that would make your trip the most memorable, what would you envision? 

Love,

Carolina

Olá Comunidade Airbnb,

Meu nome é Carolina, e eu sou... um poquinho... ""cigana"". Eu amo viajar, conhecer culturas diferentes, estudar linguas e pessoas, entender e conhecer pessoas e novas formas de viver.

No momento, me encontro no Havai, estudando para ser Parteira, trabalhando como Doula (Anjinhas que ajudam mulheres a dar a luz.) e gerenciando alguns projetos no Rio. Eu moro no Rio metade do ano, uma outra parte no Havai e alguns meses consigo viajar, quando meus desejos sao realizados. 

Eu posso dizer que sou uma ""pessoa de pessoas"", porque gosto de fazer pessoas se sentirem bem. De hospedar, a cozinhar, massagens, professora de yoga, etc. Eu simplesmente amo dividir com pessoas todas as coisas lindas que me fazem ser apaixonada pela vida nesse mundo. 

Por isso eu amo falar sobre o Brasil, viajar pelo Brasil e poder dividir essas experiencias por esse pais maravilhoso, o qual tenho orgulho de ter nascido em. O Brasil é minha casa, e o Rio meu coração. Aqui ja vivi diversas fases e conheço cenas diferentes. Desde de uma estudante de Direito com longas horas pelo centro, e conhecendo as festas de noite, á uma naturalista com longas horas no mato e em trilhas e dormindo muito a noite, á artista com longas horas de dança, teatro e circo, já fui turista por completo morando em um hostel, e agora tenho explorado o Rio com projetos pessoais, trabalhando em educaçao e as vezes produtora cultural. Eu vou crescendo e parece que o Rio cresce comigo, é sempre diferente e melhor quando volto pra casa. 

Quando viajo, gosto de sentir que ""sou de lá"". Gosto de viver a cultura e interagir com os lugares e pessoas ao maximo. Por isso, sou uma viajante muito aberta a experiencias. Quando hospedo, gosto de entender as necessidades pessoais de cada um, uma pessoa que procura meu apartamento para uma viagem de negocios, tem expectativas diferentes de alguem que veio á turismo. Pessoas viajando com familia, tem planos diferentes daqueles que vieram a procura da festa perfeita ou etc. Logo, eu gosto de escutar voces, e entender as suas necessidades, vou fazer o meu melhor para acomoda-las. 

Como não moro constantemente no Brasil, e como juntos chegaremos aonde jamais conseguiriamos chegar sozinhos, conto com a ajuda da minha Co-Anfitria. Juntas  nos queremos que os nossos hospedes se sintam em casa, o maximo possivel, queremos inovar e trazer experiencias lindas e diferentes pros nossos hospedes.

Por isso, queremos escutar voces. A sua opiniao é muito importante pra a gente nessa nova jornada.  Nosso ideal é que o mundo é só um. Somos todos um, e podemos viver assim, com amor. Uma enorme comunidade de pessoas que juntos, podemos construir coisas linda pra nós, nossa comunidade e nosso planeta. Queremos distribuir amor para as pessoas, e parte disso fazemos quando hospedamos nossos hospedes da melhor maneira que podemos. 

Qual é o seu ideal? Como você se sente em casa? Que coisas poderiam melhorar a sua estadia em um pais diferente, ou em uma cidade? Como você gosta de conhecer pessoas novas? Quais são suas intenções nessa viagem? Se você pudesse idelizar alguma coisa, qualquer coisa, que faria sua viagem inesquecivel, qual seria sua visão?

That means we love our city and are very proud of it, perhaps especially its football team – the best in Portugal! It’s also evidence of how friendly and hospitable we are, and I’ll do my best to make your visit to Porto really enjoyable. Advice on where to go, the hidden gems that most tourists never get to see, the best places to eat, the best bargains and ways of getting around on a budget – just ask.

I used to live in this apartment, but when my daughter was born, 10 years ago, I moved around the corner. That means I’m readily available to help all I can – it’s what I do for a living, so you’re sure to get my undivided attention.

I may have lived in Porto all my life, but I’ve also travelled a fair bit, to the United States, to Asia and, of course, to other parts of Europe, so I understand what travellers need, and will always do my best to make your stay go smoothly.  ",within an hour,Copacabana,89.0,False,1

ただ一つ､予約後はair bnbのｱﾌﾟﾘの更新をした上で操作の確認をすることを忘れないで下さい｡予約ﾍﾟｰｼﾞの閲覧の仕方が頻繁にｱｯﾌﾟｸﾞﾚｰﾄﾞしています｡

空港から私のｱﾊﾟｰﾄまでの位置確認､下記参考にして下さい｡

•ｻﾞﾊﾞｽ(市ﾊﾞｽ)
$2ﾄﾞﾙ75ｾﾝﾄ､(十九､二十番)で乗り換え無し､約1時間でｱﾊﾟｰﾄに到着です｡
ﾊﾞｽ内にお釣りはないのでご自身で用意するのをお忘れなく｡
大きなｽｰﾂｹｰｽをお持ちの方は乗車出来ませんが､機内持ち込みｻｲｽﾞで来られる方はﾊﾞｽで来れたら格安です!ﾊﾞｽは寒いので上着必須｡

空港発ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ行き
(7:00-8:30に乗車の場合)
ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ前発 空港行き 
(15:30-18:00に乗車の場合)
途中通勤ﾗｯｼｭに巻き込まれるので確実に1時間以上はかかります｡私もこの時間は運転しないように気をつけています｡


空港発ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ行き降車地点
 ""Kuhio Ave and launiu street"" 
ｸﾋｵｱﾍﾞﾆｭｰ ｱﾝﾄﾞ ﾗｳﾆｳｽﾄﾘｰﾄ (ﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝ目の前)
運転手にﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝに行きたいと伝えたらｽﾑｰｽﾞです｡目の前のﾊﾞｽ停で降りて下さい｡

ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ発空港行き
""Kuhio Ave and Launiu street""
同じくﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝの道を挟んだ向かいにﾊﾞｽ停が設置されています｡だいたいﾊﾞｽ停は登り､下り､道を挟んで対に設置してあります｡

ﾊﾞｽ停から歩いて30秒でｱﾊﾟｰﾄ発見､到着!ﾊﾞｽに乗り慣れていない方も一度試してみてはいかがでしょう~｡

ﾊﾞｽを降りてﾋﾟﾝｸの3､4階建の建物(個人的には一番の目印にしております)が見えたら､その角がﾗｳﾆｳ ｽﾄﾘｰﾄです｡必ず分かります｡
ﾊﾞｽ道を背に一軒先に行った左手にあるのがこの建物 414 launiu streetです｡

•ﾀｸｼｰ
荷物の積み下ろしやﾁｯﾌﾟだのでだいたい30分かかります｡ﾁｯﾌﾟ入れて$35-$40が目安でしょう｡

•ｼｬﾄﾙﾊﾞｽ
$17くらい｡
ﾜｲｷｷ行きはﾎﾃﾙで降りなければいけないことがおおいのでその際に､ﾎﾘﾃﾞｰｲﾝﾜｲｷｷｴｸｽﾌﾟﾚｽがｸﾞﾚｰﾄﾞ的にも降りても差し支えなさそうなﾎﾃﾙ(個人的意見)｡3分くらいでｱﾊﾟｰﾄに着きます｡もしくはｺﾝﾄﾞﾃﾙのﾌｫｰﾊﾟﾄﾞﾙはｱﾊﾟｰﾄの真向かいなので､停まってくれるならとても便利)

•ｳｰﾊﾞｰ､ﾘﾌﾄ
$21からと記載されています｡(変わっている可能性あり)
ｱﾌﾟﾘにどこで拾ってもらうか記載してあるので必ずその位置へお進み下さい｡

House is very secluded in a jungles in Fern Forest on a Volcano slope just 8 miles away from Volcano national park.
Unlike other B&B owners I am suggesting per your choice VIP-tours, renting a house/room (Bed and Breakfast), renting cars, fishing, hunting, whale watching, etc. in one bundle.
 Basic price for each bedroom is $89-99/night (two people). You can rent one or up to four bedrooms or entire house.
Extra guests/children can sleep on couches for basic price $20/night/guest.
If you rent two bedrooms (or just one, but without other guests), you actually have in your possession entire floor. If it is one bedroom (Master Suite), usually it is first floor with gigantic hall and porch with Jacuzzi. If it is two bedrooms - usually it is second floor with living.
Shared areas are kitchen, dining room, big covered porch with grill, office on a second floor that you have to share with other guests (if they are here) and owners who live on premises.
If you are renting room/rooms for 7 days or more - you are eligible for 10% discount;
If you are renting entire house (4 bedrooms) - you are eligible for another 10% discount;
If you are renting for a month or more - you are eligible for another 10% discount.
Sure, if you choose a bundle, you save your $$, time and nervous. For more information, please, see (Website hidden by Airbnb) and (Website hidden by Airbnb) 
There is a German Shepherd dog on premises.
Bed and Breakfast becoming more and more popular in America due to more comfort, privacy for less cost.

Choosing us you get following advantages:
1. We are local, so, you saving at least $150-250 for airfare ticket of your guide from another place;
2. We are local, so, we can show you hidden ""pearls"" that other guides even didn't hear about;
3. We are flexible - we can build your tours  according to your taste, mood, budget;
4. We can meet you at airport and bring back for a small charge;
5. If you have big group for special event, etc., we can place up to 16 people;
6. We are placed next to Volcano National Park in very quite secluded jungles (between Hilo and Kona), so, you can relax from noise and vanity of crowds and save time/money in your trips and have a good sleep during cool evening/nights in mountains without insects and noise.",within an hour,Island of Hawaiʻi,100.0,False,1

8729599,Maria,"Montreal, Quebec, Canada","Hello! 

I´m a very active AirBnB user, both as a hostess and a guest, so that allows me to (try to) be a good guest and a good hostess.  

My job has the advantage that some days I work from home, and some days I travel for work. Even though I enjoy my home greatly, I really like the idea of spending time in other places, particularly if they are warmer! 

I have two dogs I love very much. Sadly for you, they are not included with the apartment... :) I take them with me everywhere I can so you may get to meet them if you host us. They behave even better than me, but they´re hairier. But then again, I clean after them constantly, so we´re the perfect team. You must know, I´m particularly clean. OK, fine, I´m a clean freak. But I suppose it´s a good quality for a hostess, let alone for a guest! 

I spend most of my time outdoors, whether it´s exploring new and old territories, or in my backyard, which I enjoy immensely. I try to make my home a comfortable, warm and cheery place, where I can concentrate on my work during the day and a good book in the evenings. And when I feel like people-watching, giving my stove a break or enjoying the hustle and bustle of the city, I just have to turn around the corner and voilà! Everything is within walking distance. 

I consider myself a lively person, but I need my peace and quiet at home. And I´m a light sleeper so I am looking to host guests who look for a quiet spot to recover after exploring the city. And as a guest, I look for quiet spots as well, as I usually travel for work and I need to sleep well before and after a long day. 

Airbnb is made up of very different individuals and places, therefore communication, consideration and courtesy are key, and I hope you will find that in me.

I lived in China, Thailand and Mexico for years and now living in my hometown Hong Kong. I enjoy every single moment travelling from one place to another. It's the best time for me to overlook the world and to empty my mind. It is said that the world is becoming smaller and smaller. We are on the southern hemisphere in the morning and appear on the northern in just some hours. The best way for me to feel home anywhere is to meet local people! I listen to their stories and learn their cultures, respect their traditions and share mine with them. This is what travelling means to me.

Thanks to Airbnb, it provides a platform for people to meet friends and look for accommodation at reasonable price. Star-rated hotels are great, but local hosts can give you warm welcome and make you feel home.

I have years of experience hosting foreign guests through couhcsrufnig (CS), but stopped hosting since 2 years ago.

I want to let you know about myself, my job and my home studio. Firstly,  I was born in Bursa, Turkey in 1979. I have been living in Istanbul for 15 years. I have got my Bachelor Degree in Istanbul, Bilgi University, department of  Photography and Video (P.O.V.). As you see I am really interested in art and I love creating. I do my job freelance, because I belive that I need to feel free to create more and express better. I have had my own studio before I have decided to have my own home-studio. Now, I do not only love working and living here becouse of the location, but also because of the atmosphere of my place. I mean there are beautiful old houses , buildings, cafes, museums, galleries, historical places, all kinds of restaurants and all kinds of transportations options. Further more, it really helps me to  let go of anxiety, stress and feel more confortable, that is peacefull and relaxing. For instance I am able to listen loudly music whenever I would like, or I do not hear any other’s in here.  Lastly, at these days, I am planning to be a part of one art collective or collaborate with some young artists . If you like, you  can bring you ideas, creativity and art into my collaboration.

As a long standing Australian Super host, I strive to offer fabulous, unique, sparkling clean accommodation in the vibrant Sydney suburb of Newtown just 3km from the CBD, walk to Sydney Uni and RPA Hospital.  I have been offering accommodation for 17 years, before Air BnB I was listed on more commercial sites.

My point of difference is I have a ABN and my business is run to a professional standard with correct insurances etc. There are no common shared spaces. You are not squeezing into someone else home! My places are your home away from home.

Having returned from travelling, 3 times to Santa Barbara in 2018, and in 2017  (kayaking in Antarctica and exploring Chile) and having worked in Geneva and NYC, I strive to offer guests what I need myself, a very comfortable bed, quality linen, quiet but interesting environment and a place to eat and work (a real table and chairs!), a couch, outdoor space and Wifi!

Much of my time is spent travelling  and hosting and I also have my own Clinical and teaching mental health practice so I am busy!

Here's my hosting story:

In 2000 I purpose built Studio Q as a stand alone Studio in my garden in O'Connor, a sought after leafy inner suburb with cafes a easy 10 min walk away.  The City is 3km away and ANU a 15 min walk.  This property has been sold but Simon is now hosting Studio Q.

In Newton (Sydney) I have 3 fantastic apartments in the same complex with a roof top garden.  3 mins to the train and on ""the strip"" of restaurants, cafes, bookshops, movie and live theatres.  Please read more under Newtown Mews listings.

You will find my favourite local tips in each unit (i.e. best local cafes, great walks and the best the area has to offer).

We ended up moving back to the mainland a year later, but in the intervening years, we vacationed there many times as a family. One of the twins eventually heeded the island's call and in 2012 moved to Princeville with her husband and family.

Im an English teacher who loves her job so much. I studied in England, lived there for seven years( considering its a long time)  I sometimes confuse my nationalty :)  I love music both listening and making. I play violin and guitar and besides Im a dance teacher too. I am a nature person who runs away to the mountains and lakes and camp there in her tiny spare time. I work busy hours because ı only work with business people.

My place is very central which is in a walking distance to all puplic transports and easy to get to and find. We have three bedroom in my big flat and ı sometimes I invite my students in the living room for lessons but very rarely. If you see people laughing around dont be surprised :) The building is not pretty new as nearly all flats are the same in Kadikoy area.  My neighbourhood is very safe and everybody knows eachother here and all of them are lovely people. I used to have a dog in the last years as you read in the rewievs but my friend  took her from me to a lovely farm where she is free and happy. House will be very clean when you checked in and I dont do a deep cleaning until you leave so try to be nice and tidy :) There are no rules in this house!!! I love people who treats this area as their own place. 

I have been hosting people on Airbnb for three years and had lovely friends and unforgetable experiences. Some of them stayed for a day and some of them stayed for three months bu we still keep in touch with most of them. I love meeting new people, listening different stories, learn abour their culture. Maybe Ill ask you to go out together if we have or play a game or even a long chat if you want ofcourse.

We have 3 children ages 8, 12 and 15 that attend a private and public school here on Kauai.  They help out with the BnB when time allows between their studies and extracurricular activities.  We enjoy the beach, hiking, horseback riding, paddle boarding, beach Volley Ball, fishing, and soccer. 
As we love music, we also own an event company called Hawaiian Muzik Factory, so we do weddings, anniverseries, baby parties, graduation parties ect. We also have large event tents, tables, sound systems, lights, and live bands.  Between the kids, the BnB and the Muzik Factory, it is a busy fun life in paradise! We look forward to meeting you!

Our property has a solar heated salt water pool and jacuzzi. Located right in the middle of the island, so you can go to north shore or south shore in 45 min to an hour either way.  No need to bounce accomadations to see the whole island! We live on the property and are available for assistance most of the time. Some of the best restaurants, beaches and shopping is only minutes away. Hiking trails on the Sleeping Giant are within walking distance. We offer a continental breakfast that varies depending on availability of local produce and fruits ect. We do not have breakfast on Sundays and Holidays as that is our family time:). We are a family run operation and look forward to hosting you:).

I bought and remodeled the house in Hana for quick Maui staycations to surf and play in the rainforest hikes with family and friends, and the design of the home and cottage is to my type of lifestyle, indoor/outdoor living, comfortable furnishings, and ample room to prepare meals and relax.

Some of my favorite travel destinations are Canada and Colorado for the boarding, camping, hiking and biking, houseboat trips to Lake Powell, and, if time/money allow, the southwest of France for the surf, food, wine and culture.

My travel style has modified over the years.  It used to be budget all the way.  Those years are behind me, now I prefer a reasonable price, a clean place, with amenities, and convenience to the happening spots in the area, which is exactly what I want to provide for others in Hana as an Airbnb host.

It's a big world out there, set aside some time for yourself and explore!!

24293332,Kerem,Istanbul / TR.,"Greetings! Despite how unnatural it feels to try and ""describe"" a human being, especially one's own self, let's give it a shot. I'm an independent game developer, which is a fancy term for ""a human who's chosen not to earn as much money as he could be earning in order not to be told how to do things"". Having lived in almost every part of Istanbul (and therefore having seen its lowest as well as its highest) I found myself unable to move away from the Galata area and eventually settled here.

As a host, I'm doing Airbnb for the sake of meeting with new people and having an excuse for drinking more beer. Being into this sort of a thing solely for the purpose of having an extra income is, tho I respect that choice as well, just not for me. I'm more of a ""eh, let's be off with the fake pleasantries, fake smiles, fake impersonations and hit the damned pub!"" person, being much more into conversations and interactions where all sides are genuine and not parts of self-made scripts. 

There's something lovely about knowing that I've helped someone enjoy their trip more. It's not always easy getting a taste of the local life in Istanbul since authentic cities such as this are also usually hyper-touristy. What's more is that the understanding of a ""local life"" will differ from one part of the city to another, it's as non homogeneous as it gets and that's why I love helping my guests around - so that they can experience how we ""the Galata area people"" live.

10790369,Ewa,"Rio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","I moved from Berlin to Rio in 2012. Davi and me bought this big old house that needed a lot of work to be done. We renovated it completely and tried to keep it as original as possible. We did most of the work ourselves, so it took about 4 years to complete it. Since we had more space than we needed, we decided to give Airbnb a try and it's being a really good experience since. We have been lucky to have nice guests that share many common interests and have a fun time in the city.

I work also with photography (artistic, street) and some graphic design. Davi works as a carpenter building furniture. Most of the house's furniture was made by him. If guests share these (or other) interests, we are always open to show and hand out, what we know about brazilian culture, habits, photographers, artists and etc.",within an hour,Santa Teresa,100.0,True,6

3479346,Ewa & Pau,"Barcelona, Cataluña, Spain","I was born in Barcelona and I have been lucky to live in this beautiful city all my life. I am married with children and we both love meeting people from all around the world. We love food and cooking, traveling... we enjoy sharing experiences with people and help you with everything you could need in Barcelona.

We started hosting on Airbnb about 3 years ago and the experience has been amazing. Its great to have the opportunity to meet new people every week and help them have a perfect stay. That have been incredible years!

As we have young children and sometimes it is difficult to manage everything with a baby at home, our friend Ewa is giving us a hand! She is from Poland and has been living in Barcelona for many years, so she is also happy to meet a lot of people from all around the world and give you some tips about our great city!",within a few hours,Dreta de l'Eixample,100.0,False,14
